    <h1>JavaScript Basics: Variables, Scope, Let, and Const</h1>

    <h2>What are Variables?</h2>
    <p>
      Variables in JavaScript are like containers or boxes where you store data,
      like numbers or text. You create a variable using special keywords, and
      give it a name to use it later in your code.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Scope?</h2>
    <p>
      Scope is a concept in JavaScript that defines where variables and
      functions are accessible. There are mainly two types of scope:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Global Scope:</strong> Variables declared outside of all
        functions are available everywhere in your code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Scope:</strong> Variables declared within a function are
        only accessible within that function.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is Block Scope?</h2>
    <p>
      Block scope, introduced in ES6, is a type of scope that confines variables
      to the block where they are declared. A block is a set of curly braces
      <code>{ }</code> in your code, like in <code>if</code> statements, loops,
      etc. Variables declared with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are
      bound to the block scope, meaning they can only be accessed within that
      specific block.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding <code>let</code></h2>
    <p>
      The <code>let</code> keyword is used to declare variables that are limited
      to the scope of a block. This means you can have different variables with
      the same name in different blocks without conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variables declared with <code>let</code> can have their values changed,
      but they cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding <code>const</code></h2>
    <p>
      The <code>const</code> keyword is for declaring variables that should not
      change after their initial assignment. Like <code>let</code>,
      <code>const</code> is also limited to block scope, but it prevents
      reassigning or redeclaring the variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use <code>const</code> for values that you want to remain constant, but
      remember that the properties of objects or the contents of arrays declared
      with <code>const</code> can still be changed.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding variables and scope is crucial in JavaScript. Block scope,
      particularly with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>, provides a more
      secure and error-free way of managing your data. Remember, use
      <code>let</code> for variables that may change and <code>const</code> for
      those that should remain constant.
